It's been over a year since I last shared a new song with any of my fans and followers
(read: Mom). Between schoolwork, internships, and my commitment to the Cornell men's
ultimate frisbee team, I've had so little time to put towards writing anything new,
let alone finishing up old tracks. To be honest, it saddens me to think of how many fragments of 
songs I have lying around FL Studio. Anyway, inspiration struck again the other night, and now
I'm elated to be sharing something new!

Inspiration came after watching a beautiful movie called "People Like Us", and as I was
working, I decided I had to put together a clip of my favorite scene and the song that it
inspired. I'm not much of a film editor, but it feels right to me. Check it out
