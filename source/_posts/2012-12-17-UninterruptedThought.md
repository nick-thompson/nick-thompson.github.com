That quote might be the most valuable extract from a blog post or article that I've seen in a long time. 
As a student following a relatively challenging curriculum, the nagging feeling of not having enough time is
always in the back of my head. Having read Adam's post, I'm now putting more effort
into valuing the moments where I can have uninterrupted thought, and trying to make good use of those
moments. Here's to hoping this will help me be more productive, less stressed, and have more free time.
I highly recommend you read his post if you haven't yet.
