I've never really been much into blogs, but as of late I've been taking a much
more serious approach to furthering my knowledge and my self as a web developer,
and in doing so I've really come to appreciate them, and the people behind them.
Taking the time to share something that you just discovered or learned has the
potential to help other people so much. The fact that that is such a strong
characteristic of the open source web community is really exciting.

Anyway, so, between that, and this [interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhWGSD_TY2Y)
I just saw with Paul Irish, I'm starting this blog in hopes of contributing
back to the open source web community.

My interests are mostly on the front-end side of web development, particularly
javascript, so I anticipate that my thoughts here will be along those lines.
I've been spending a lot of time lately experimenting with the new HTML5 Web
Audio API, and I plan to do the same with the Web MIDI API that's coming soon
to your browser, so you can expect a lot of what I'll be posting about in the near future
relates thereto. Occasionally I dabble with python, and more and more lately I've been
thinking I should learn ruby and rails.
