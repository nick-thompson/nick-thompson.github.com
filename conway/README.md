# Conway
This is a simple generative sequencer experiment based around Conway's Game of
Life and the Web Audio API. Notes are generated and played back based on the
position of each live cell at the time of drawing that cell, and the cell's life
is governed as expected by the rules of the game.

This is based on Will Bailey's implementation of Conway's Game of Life, found
